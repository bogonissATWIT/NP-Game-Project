# TCP-Tac-Toe

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional game of Tic-Tac-Toe that
users can play over a TCP connection. The user will need to simply run the Java Client code. 
The Client code will then connect to a host servers IP address and port.
The server will then handle the game functionalities and features,
with the client sending their inputs back to the server when requested.

## Deliverables

At the end of the semester, we plan to deliver a fully functional game of Tic-Tac-Toe with
unique features such as custom names, custom lobby names, and more.

## Features 

1. User can enter their name.
2. Users can choose to either create a new lobby, or join an existing lobby (newly created lobbies will have custom names set by the user).
3. If the user chooses to join an existing lobby, they will be presented with a list of available lobbies.
4. Users will alternate turns sending an input (move).
5. The board will print out for both users whenever a turn has ended.
6. Once a game concludes, the server will announce a winner to both users.
