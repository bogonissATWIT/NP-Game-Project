# Your project name

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional game of Tic-Tac-Toe that
users can play (remotely and locally) over a TCP connection. The user will need to
simply run the Java Client code. The Client code will then connect to a host servers
IP address and port. The server will then handle the game functionalities and features,
with the client sending their inputs back to the server when requested.

## Deliverables

At the end of the semester, we plan to deliver a fully functional game of Tic-Tac-Toe with
unique features such as custom names, custom player lobby descriptions, and more.

## Features 

1. User can enter their name
2. User can choose a lobby to play in
3. Users will alternate turns sending an input
4. The board will print out for both users whenever a turn has ended
5. Once a game concludes, the server will announce a winner to both users
